# Ryan's Portfolio

#### By Ryan Gibson

#### My own personal webpage to show to show off my work and progress I have made.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript
- Bootstrap

## Description
This website will be created with a more basic programming environment. The website will be my personal portfolio to showcase my work at Epicodus and anything else I plan to do in the future. Also, my contact information and social media info. I want my portfolio to not only show my work, but also reflect some of my personality in the process. Hopefully giving potential employers a better idea of who I am. I want the page to demonstrate that I am dedicated to programming. I will have a section with goals I want to accomplish as well as goals that I have already accomplished. It will be an ever growing list that I will update regularly.
