# Name of project: Personal Portfolio

### Project's Purpose and Goals:
This will be a website with its own domain name. The domain name will be as close to my own name as possible. The website will be my personal portfolio to showcase my work at Epicodus and anything else I plan to do in the future. Also, my contact information and social media info. I want my portfolio to not only show my work, but also reflect some of my personality in the process. Hopefully giving potential employers a better idea of who I am.

It will be an ever growing list that I will update regularly.
